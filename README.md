# MultiVehicle Route Optimizer

Work in progress üõ†Ô∏è ‚Äî CLI tool in C++ to find optimal routes for multiple vehicles (car, bike, truck, bus) using Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm.

## Planned Features
- Vehicle-specific optimization (speed/fuel)
- Real-world city data simulation
- CLI input/output
- Modular graph-based implementation

## Status
Currently working on:
- Graph structure and vehicle models
- Dijkstra algorithm integration

## To Do
- [x] Project setup
- [ ] Graph construction from input
- [ ] Vehicle-specific route cost calculation
- [ ] CLI integration
